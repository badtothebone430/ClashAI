"""O8: offline harness measuring play.py's OpponentElixirEstimator against ENGINE ground truth, under THREE
input conditions, driven through the SAME engine match loop e1_eval uses (held-out ghost pool v1, live S1
policy). Does not modify pipeline/e1_eval.py, pipeline/e1_view.py, pipeline/obs_contract.py,
pipeline/engine_play.py, pipeline/e1_pool.py, or anything under icebow/src or hogeq/src -- every one of
those is IMPORTED unmodified. The per-tick loop below is a NEW instrumented copy of e1_eval.run_match's
while-loop (not a subclass -- run_match returns only match-level aggregates, no per-tick truth/estimate),
built entirely out of e1_eval's own pure helpers (obs_seed, _slot_maps, allowed_slots, anti_stall,
model_forward, live_decide) plus e1_pool.PoolV1Env, e1_view.live_view, obs_contract.from_engine/to_tokens,
and engine_play.compact_raw/cell_center/cell_to_engine/load_model -- all imported, none copied.

ATTEMPT 2 changes (progress file "## Attempt 2" has the full writeup):

CHANGE 1 -- estimator cadence. Live feeds ``_opp_elx.update()`` every detector/perception frame (~4-5 Hz),
NOT once per policy decision (0.5 s / 10 engine ticks) -- attempt 1 fed it at the (too coarse) decision
cadence, which the estimator's ``match_radius=0.07`` (~1.3 tiles) was never tuned to tolerate: a unit that
moves more than that between SAMPLES (not between real detector frames) loses its track and is double-charged
as a new play. Fix: step the engine in ``STEP_TICKS=5``-tick increments; call ``update()`` on every estimator
at EVERY 5-tick step; run the live policy only every ``decide_every`` (still 10) ticks, i.e. every OTHER step,
at the identical ticks attempt 1 (and e1_eval itself) decided on. The engine is a deterministic function of
history, so ``EngineMatchEnv._advance_to(target)`` (an absolute tick, stepping tick-by-tick and stopping
exactly on ghost ticks regardless of chunk size -- scratchpad/gauntlet/L62/engine_env.py:401-414) produces a
BIT-IDENTICAL state at tick 100 whether reached via one ``_advance_to(100)`` call or two 5-tick calls; the
smoke re-run confirms ``plays_accepted`` per match is unchanged from attempt 1 (see progress file).
RNG split this forces: e1_eval's own ``rng_obs`` (seeded ``obs_seed(tag, k)``) is consumed ONLY at policy
ticks, exactly as attempt 1 / e1_eval -- so the POLICY's decisions (and thus ``plays_accepted``) stay
byte-identical. Condition B needs a degraded view at the NON-policy 5-tick steps too, for which e1_eval has
no cadence of its own to borrow -- those extra draws come from a second, harness-local generator seeded
``b5_seed(tag, k)`` (module-level, same crc32 style as ``e1_eval.obs_seed``/``random_seed``, deliberately a
different domain string so it can never collide with e1_eval's own stream). This is the one place this
harness draws its own randomness; every other draw is e1_eval's.

CHANGE 2 -- condition A+ (``est_Aplus``): perfect detection INCLUDING spells (``bs.spells``, not just
``bs.units``). Quantifies part of the blind spot attempt 1 found: play.py:547 pre-filters ``dets`` to
``team == "enemy" and base in observation.detector_cards`` before ``update()`` ever sees them. A (units only,
NO whitelist applied -- see ATTEMPT 4's correction below, this claim was wrong in earlier attempts) is kept
as an upper-bound ceiling; A+ (units + spells, also no whitelist) is the strictly-better ceiling if spells
were ever priced in at all. A spell whose CardDB cost is None (measured in attempt 1: Mirror -- dynamic
pricing, no flat ``elixir`` key) is skipped from A+'s dets (not charged as a free play) and logged ONCE per
base name per process, per the ticket.

Per-tick rows now carry ``truth_drop`` (attempt 1 folded this into a boolean; the raw size makes multi-play
aliasing inside one decision window visible instead of hidden -- see progress file). Summaries add
``bias`` (not just MAE) at opponent-play ticks, and an MAE split by ``truth >= 9.0`` (near the [0,10] cap,
where the counting identity is expected to strain) vs below.

ATTEMPT 3 (progress file "## Attempt 3" has the full writeup): diagnostic for the coordinator's
spawned-units hypothesis (attempt 2's A_bias moved -3.42 -> -3.34 under the cadence fix, i.e. barely, so
track loss from a too-coarse sample rate is not the dominant cause of the persistent NEGATIVE bias; a
negative bias under ``est = my_elixir + my_spent - opp_spent`` with PERFECT detection means ``opp_spent`` is
counting more than the opponent actually spent -- something is being charged that should not be). Two new
per-condition ledgers:
  ``charged_by_base`` -- every base the estimator's own ``_opp_spent`` accounting actually charged, and how
    much. Built by ``TrackedEstimator``, a subclass that does NOT reimplement or duplicate any of
    ``OpponentElixirEstimator``'s tracking/clustering logic (which would risk drifting from the real
    algorithm): ``update()`` is the ONLY place ``_opp_spent`` is ever incremented from a detection (the
    saturation rebase at lines 122-129 is a bookkeeping correction, not attributable to a specific card), and
    the ONLY thing that method reads to price a new track is exactly one call, ``self.db.elixir(base)``
    (opponent_elixir.py:109). ``TrackedEstimator.update()`` temporarily swaps ``self.db`` for a one-shot
    recorder proxy for the duration of the (unmodified) ``super().update()`` call, restores the real ``db``
    immediately after, and attributes every call the REAL charging code made (base, cost) with cost > 0 to
    ``charged_by_base``. This is the faithful option over diffing ``_opp_spent`` before/after: a diff cannot
    tell two different bases apart when both become new tracks inside the SAME ``update()`` call (a common
    case once ``update()`` batches several 5-tick-cadence detections), while wrapping the collaborator
    captures the real per-base charge event with no re-implementation and no ambiguity.
  ``ghost_played_by_base`` -- the TRUTH ledger: the opponent's actual card plays, from ``entry["ghost_commands"]``
    (the exact list ``PoolV1Mixin``/``EngineMatchEnv`` re-drives in eval mode -- e1_pool.py's own ``_cmd()``
    rows), excluding ability entries (``card`` is ``None``), costed via the SAME ``CardDB`` (never the
    engine's own recorded ``cost`` field, so both ledgers price off one source) after normalizing the pool's
    hyphenated slugs (``"giant-snowball"``) to vocab's underscore convention and folding evo/hero suffixes
    with ``vocab.base_key`` -- the SAME base-key space ``charged_by_base`` uses, so the two ledgers are
    directly comparable base-for-base.
Summary adds, per condition: an over-charge table (base | ghost_plays | ghost_elixir | charges |
charged_elixir | over_charge, top 25 by |over_charge| absolute value), ``total_over_charge``, and
``over_charge_share_from_bases_never_played`` (the fraction of charged elixir landing on bases the ghost
NEVER played at all -- a spawned body, e.g. tombstone's skeletons or a witch's summons, is BY DEFINITION not
in ``ghost_deck``/``ghost_commands`` since only the 8 played cards are, so this number directly tests the
spawned-units hypothesis). Per-match: ``over_charge_at_end`` (total charged elixir minus total ghost elixir
for that match) per condition, in each match's summary and in ``summary.json``'s
``over_charge_at_end_by_match``.

ATTEMPT 4 (progress file "## Attempt 4" has line numbers for every fix; blind verifier report
scratchpad/gauntlet/L67/opp_est/V8_verify.md, baseline 06dcc6d):

FIX 1 (the verifier's FAIL) -- the over-charge truth ledger was built from ``entry["ghost_commands"]``, the
SCRIPT, but the verifier measured (ctrl_live100, 100 matches) only 2429 of 3796 scripted ghost plays were
ever DELIVERED (68 refused, 1299 undelivered because 62/100 matches end before the script does) -- biasing
every over-charge figure NEGATIVE by about a third of ghost elixir, directly confounding the diagnosis. Fixed
by reading ``env.ghost_cards_delivered`` (a ``collections.Counter`` keyed by slug; ``PoolV1Mixin.reset()``
zeroes it per match at e1_pool.py:519, ``_fire_ghosts_at`` increments it ONLY on an accepted, non-mine ghost
play at e1_pool.py:562) at the end of each match and costing THAT via CardDB -- ``ghost_delivered_by_base``.
The old function is kept as ``ghost_scripted_by_base`` (same source, same costing) for reference ONLY,
clearly labelled in the summary and NEVER fed into ``over_charge``/``total_over_charge``/
``over_charge_share_from_bases_never_played``/``over_charge_at_end``, all of which now read exclusively from
``ghost_delivered_by_base``.

FIX 2 -- ``is_opp_play_tick`` (truth-drop >= 1.0) silently misses every 1-cost ghost play (regen offsets a
1-elixir drop below the threshold; the verifier measured 1613/12205 = 13% of held-out ghost plays cost 1).
Replaced with ``opp_play_flags``, a pure function over (a) the ascending list of this match's sampled ticks
and (b) ``env.ghost_events`` (a ``(tick, accepted 0/1, reason)`` log the SAME ghost-drive path already keeps,
engine_env.py:334 initializes it empty per match, PoolV1Mixin._fire_ghosts_at appends to it on every ghost
play attempt whether accepted or refused): the FIRST sampled tick at or after each ACCEPTED delivery's
recorded tick is flagged. CAVEAT, stated plainly: the recorded tick is the play's ORIGINAL SCRIPTED tick
(``g["tick"]``), not necessarily the engine tick it was actually accepted at -- a `not_enough_elixir` refusal
retries up to ``elixir_slack`` (40 ticks / 2s) later before either succeeding or being counted as refused
(e1_pool.py's ``_fire_ghosts_at``). Since the real accept tick is always >= the recorded one, flagging the
first sample at-or-after the recorded tick never MISSES a delivery, but for a retried play it can flag one or
two samples slightly EARLY (before the unit is actually visible on board). ``truth_drop`` (attempt 3) is kept
as an informational column, no longer used to set the flag.

FIX 3 -- per-match ``outcome``/``crowns_for``/``crowns_against`` (``ep._outcome(env, state)``'s second return
value was being discarded), ``plays_accepted``, ``decisions``, ``end_tick``, ``n_ticks`` are now persisted in
``summary.json``'s ``matches: [...]`` and in the final JSON line, field-for-field the same spelling
``e1_eval.run_match`` writes to ``matches.jsonl`` (``outcome`` a "win"/"draw"/"loss" string, ``crowns_for``/
``crowns_against`` ints, ``plays_accepted`` the accepted-play count) -- so the lead can diff this harness's
matches directly against ``attrib_noise/ctrl_live100/slot0/matches.jsonl`` as a fidelity gate.

FIX 4 -- condition ``A_wl``: perfect detection, enemy units only, WITH live's ``observation.detector_cards``
whitelist applied (``load_detector_cards``, loads ``icebow/config/config.yaml`` through the SAME unmodified
``clashrl.config.Config`` play.py itself uses -- ``cfg.get("observation", "detector_cards", default=[])``,
play.py:376). This is live's ACTUAL structural ceiling (A, kept unchanged, is a looser upper bound with no
whitelist at all -- the earlier "100% troop/building, zero spell entries" claim in CHANGE 2 above was WRONG
and is corrected here). MEASURED, independently re-derived from the pool file (not just taken from the
verifier): the whitelist has 46 entries; ``the_log`` (a spell -- ``vocab.SPELL_CLASSES`` -- config.yaml:494)
IS one of them, so "zero spell entries" was false. Across the held-out split's 12205 non-ability ghost card
plays, 4202 (34.4%) are non-spell bases the whitelist excludes (e.g. archer_queen, golem, mega_minion); of
the 9614 non-spell plays specifically, that is 4202/9614 = 43.7% -- both framings are given here since the
verifier's "34%" used the ALL-plays denominator, not the non-spell one. Summaries now report A+, A, A_wl, B.

NOTE (no fix needed, flagged by the verifier): ``--max-ticks`` truncates each match at that row count, and
``ep._outcome`` is then computed on a NON-TERMINAL engine state -- the CLI help now says this is smoke-only.

TICKET O10 -- charge-event TRACE (no fix; instrumentation only). ATTEMPT 4's over-charge tables (real audit,
condition A) found continuously-visible SINGLE units re-billed many times over (tombstone: 58 delivered plays
-> 442 charges; miner 28 -> 201; witch 16 -> 142) despite ``_find_track`` (opponent_elixir.py:101-105)
appearing, by reading, to refresh a matched track's timestamp every update rather than re-charging it. This
adds ``--charge-trace``: for condition A ONLY, ``<out>/charges.jsonl`` (one row per actual ``_opp_spent``
increment, with the diagnostics needed to tell WHY the charge happened) and ``<out>/track_events.jsonl`` (one
row per track EXPIRY, i.e. every base ``_seen_tracks`` -- opponent_elixir.py:42-43 -- actually removes).

``TracedEstimator(TrackedEstimator)`` gets both WITHOUT re-implementing any tracking/matching/clustering
logic and WITHOUT touching opponent_elixir.py: it overrides ``_seen_tracks`` to diff ``self._tracks``
before/after the real (unmodified) ``super()._seen_tracks(now)`` call -- the ticket's own "diff before/after"
option, chosen over "replicate the same filter" because a diff can never drift from the real ``forget_s``
comparison if that constant or the comparison operator ever changes. ``update()`` snapshots ``self._tracks``
by object identity BEFORE calling ``super().update()`` (which runs the real, unmodified expiry -> match ->
cluster -> charge pipeline), then reads off which tracks in the POST-update list are new objects (never
mutated in place, only ever created fresh inside ``_cluster_new``'s loop, opponent_elixir.py:107-108) and
zips them 1:1, in order, against ``TrackedEstimator``'s own ``_RecorderDB`` call list (order-preserved because
both the ``self._tracks.append(...)`` and the ``self.db.elixir(base)`` call sit in the SAME loop iteration,
opponent_elixir.py:107-111) to recover (base, x, y, cost) for every actual charge, cost > 0 only, mirroring
``charged_by_base``'s own gate exactly.

Per-charge diagnostics are computed by the harness (``charge_diagnostics``), never inside the estimator, from
two things the estimator itself does not remember past one call: the PREVIOUS sample's det list (caller-
tracked, one match at a time) and the pre-update track snapshot ``TracedEstimator.update`` already captured
for its own bookkeeping. ``classify_charge_reason`` turns those into a best-effort ``reason`` string; see the
module's inline comment on that function for the one place its evaluation order deliberately departs from the
ticket text's literal listing order (and why -- the "rebill_after_expiry" acceptance scenario forces it).
Full writeup: scratchpad/gauntlet/L67/opp_fix/O10_trace.md.

TICKET O16 -- two new measurement conditions, both OFF by default (``--tracker``, ``--corr``; existing
runs byte-identical). Full writeup: scratchpad/gauntlet/L67/opp_fix/O16_tracker.md.

(a) TRACKER-INPUT (``--tracker``): condition B's raw dets feed billing directly (module docstring
above, "the estimator is fed raw dets instead" -- play.py:558). Live never does this: play.py:518
runs ``TeamTracker.tag()`` first and only THEN filters to ``d.team == "enemy"`` (play.py:547) before
``_opp_elx.update()`` ever sees a det. ``B_tt`` closes that gap: a ``TeamTracker`` (constructed with
live's own defaults -- ``make_team_tracker()`` below, cited against play.py:420-441 /
live_reader_audit.py:185-199) is fed the SAME per-sample det stream condition B already draws (no new
noise), and the V2 estimator is billed ONE synthetic det per track's FIRST sample at ``hits >=
min_hits`` ("first confirmed sighting"), at that track's position/base, team forced "enemy" (only
enemy-verdict tracks are ever billed) -- never the same track twice (``id(track)`` is a stable
per-track identity for its life, the SAME technique O10's ``TracedEstimator`` already uses for
track-expiry diffing; see ``tt_bill_dets``). ``B_corrS_tt``/``B_corrL_tt`` are the same billing scheme
over the correlated det streams (b) below, one independent ``TeamTracker`` per stream. KNOWN GAP: this
harness never renders pixels, so the HP-bar (rank 3) and body-art (rank 5) evidence ranks in
``TeamTracker._verdict`` cannot be simulated; the noisy per-sample team already baked into a detection
by ``degrade()``/``corr_live_view`` (UNKNOWN_TEAM_RATE / WRONG_TEAM_RATE) is wired into ``body_vote``
instead (the closest live analog: a noisy single-frame colour read) so the ladder's last-resort rank
still gets SOME evidence rather than none; ``bar_vote`` stays ``None`` throughout (rank 3 never fires).
Every det (mine + enemy + unknown side) is fed to the tracker, exactly as live's ``dets_all`` is,
so the deck veto / own-play anchor / motion prior see the same population a real run would.

(b) CORRELATED DEGRADE (``--corr``): ``pipeline/opp_est_degrade_corr.corr_live_view`` -- a NEW,
harness-local module (obs_contract.py / e1_view.py untouched, imported read-only). Full design
rationale, the closed-form Markov/AR(1) derivations, and the UNMEASURED-persistence-length caveat are
in that module's own docstring (read it before touching any constant here) and repeated in the
progress file. Two settings, both always run when ``--corr`` is set: ``CORR_SHORT`` (L_miss=1.5,
L_fp=1.5, rho=0.3) and ``CORR_LONG`` (L_miss=4, L_fp=8, rho=0.8) -- conditions ``B_corrS``/``B_corrL``
(raw-det estimator) and, additionally under ``--tracker``, ``B_corrS_tt``/``B_corrL_tt``. Each corr
setting gets its OWN per-match ``new_state()`` track dict and its OWN harness-local RNG stream
(``corrS_seed``/``corrL_seed``, same crc32-domain discipline as ``b5_seed``) -- never e1_eval's own
streams, never shared between settings, never re-used across matches.

(c) CONDITION-SET GENERALIZATION: ``BASE_CONDS`` (the 4-tuple ``Aplus/A/A_wl/B``) is UNCHANGED --
existing imports/tests that pin its exact shape keep working. ``active_base_conds(tracker, corr)``
returns the FULL set actually run this invocation (``BASE_CONDS`` plus whichever of
``B_tt``/``B_corrS``/``B_corrL``/``B_corrS_tt``/``B_corrL_tt`` are enabled), and every per-tick/
per-match data structure that used to iterate ``BASE_CONDS`` directly (the estimator dict, the dets/
my_elixir/n_enemy_dets maps, the row-building loops) now iterates ``active_base_conds(...)`` instead --
with both flags off this is BYTE-IDENTICAL to ``BASE_CONDS``, so ticks.jsonl/summary.json/summary.md
are unchanged for every existing invocation. ``_HIST_FIELD``/``tick_field`` gained entries for the five
new conditions (their OWN name, no historical spelling to preserve) so ticks.jsonl's new columns are
``est_B_tt``, ``n_enemy_dets_B_tt``, etc. -- for a ``_tt`` condition, ``n_enemy_dets_*`` counts dets
BILLED this sample (tracks newly confirmed), not raw enemy detections visible, since that is what is
actually fed to ``update()``; documented here and in the progress file, not just left to be inferred.

TICKET O16 ATTEMPT 2 -- blind verifier fixes (progress file "## Attempt 2" has the full writeup; the
corr module's marginals PASSED cleanly and were NOT touched).

FIX 1 (HIGH) -- ``billed_ids`` no longer keys on ``id(track dict)``. A track dict is freed the instant
``TeamTracker.tag()`` drops it from ``self._tracks``, and CPython's small-object allocator can (and, per
the verifier's 200-sequential-track probe, DOES) hand that exact address to the next same-shaped dict it
allocates -- a later, genuinely different track landing on a recycled address used to look
"already billed" under the old key and was silently never charged. Fixed by stamping a per-tracker
MONOTONIC uid into each track dict on first sight (``tr["_bill_uid"]``, from a counter
``make_team_tracker`` attaches to the instance as ``tracker._o16_uid_counter`` -- a dynamic attribute,
not a change to ``TeamTracker``/replay_mine.py itself) and keying ``billed_ids`` on THAT. Immune to
address recycling by construction: a freshly allocated dict starts with none of its own keys regardless
of which address it occupies. See ``tt_bill_dets``'s docstring for the full before/after reasoning.

FIX 2 (MEDIUM) -- ``B_tt`` (and its corr-setting siblings) is an IDEALISED DESIGN UNDER TEST, not a
measurement of what live's estimator path actually does today: live bills every enemy-tagged,
whitelisted det EVERY FRAME with no confirmation gate at all (play.py:547,558 -- ``min_hits`` lives only
in ``enemy_tracks()``, which feeds threat/aim logic, never ``_opp_elx.update()``). Every "_tt" label
(module docstring, ``BASE_LABELS`` in ``main()``) now says so explicitly. (b) Added the LIVE-REACHABLE
sibling of every "_tt" condition -- ``B_tt_wl``, ``B_corrS_tt_wl``, ``B_corrL_tt_wl``: the SAME
confirmed-track billing, additionally requiring the billed det's base to clear live's
``detector_cards`` whitelist (``filter_whitelisted_billed_dets``, applied to the tracker's OUTPUT, the
same place play.py:547's own filter sits relative to play.py:518's ``tag()`` call -- so a condition and
its "_wl" sibling share ONE ``tag()``/billing call per sample; tracking never forks between them, only
what is ultimately billed to each one's own estimator does). ``active_base_conds``/``build_cond_defs``
updated so ``--tracker --corr`` now yields (in order): ``Aplus, A, A_wl, B, B_tt, B_tt_wl, B_corrS,
B_corrS_tt, B_corrS_tt_wl, B_corrL, B_corrL_tt, B_corrL_tt_wl``.

FIX 3 (LOW) -- ``tt_dets_of`` now passes the RAW (unstripped) detector class name as ``Detection.cls``
when the pipeline det carries one (``_Det.raw_cls``, new optional field ``dets_of`` now fills in,
defaulting to None so every existing ``_Det(base, cx, gy, team)`` positional call is unaffected), falling
back to the already-stripped ``.base`` otherwise. Before this fix ``cls`` was always the stripped base
(e.g. "poison" instead of "poison_aoe"), so ``TeamTracker``'s zone-class rule (``d.cls in
ZONE_CLASSES``, where ``ZONE_CLASSES`` IS ``vocab.AOE_CLASSES`` -- raw "_aoe"-suffixed names) could never
fire. No effect on any measurement produced so far (every det stream billed through a tracker today is
units-only, per ``dets_of(bs.units)``/``dets_of(view.units)``/``dets_of(cview.units)`` -- no spells/zones
in the mix yet), kept faithful for whenever that changes.

LOW (docstring accuracy, verifier-flagged) -- re-checked: this module and ``opp_est_degrade_corr.py``
never described the false-positive process as a "random walk" anywhere (grepped both files plus the
progress file to confirm) -- both have always called it what it is, an AR(1) process about the host
unit's position (module docstring (b) above, and ``opp_est_degrade_corr.py``'s own docstring, design
item 2/3). No wording change was needed; noted here rather than silently assuming the flag applied.

    (play.py:547,558; the ``min_hits`` gate lives only in ``enemy_tracks()``, which feeds threat/aim
    logic, never the elixir estimator). This function is the hypothesis "bill once per
    TeamTracker-CONFIRMED track instead" -- see ``B_tt``'s condition label in ``main()`` for the same
    caveat surfaced in summary.md.

    Feeds ``pipeline_dets`` (condition B/corr's own det stream for this sample, unmodified -- via
    ``tt_dets_of`` above) to ``tracker.tag()``, then returns one ``_Det`` per track that just reached
    ``tracker.min_hits`` for the FIRST time ("first confirmed sighting") -- team 'enemy' only (a track
    the tracker calls 'mine'/'unknown' is never billed), never a track already in ``billed_ids``.

    O16 attempt 2 FIX 1 (verifier, HIGH -- the previous version of this docstring's own justification
    was WRONG): ``billed_ids`` no longer holds ``id(track dict)``. A track dict is freed the moment
    ``TeamTracker.tag()`` drops it from ``self._tracks`` (module docstring -- CPython's small-object
    allocator then happily hands that exact address to the NEXT same-shaped dict it allocates), so two
    DIFFERENT tracks over a match's lifetime can share the same ``id()`` in sequence -- a later track
    landing on a recycled address would silently look "already billed" and never get charged. Verified
    live by the blind verifier's own probe (200 sequential distinct tracks, each seen twice then a 5 s
    gap between them, produced fewer than 200 bills under the old ``id()`` key).

    FIXED by stamping a per-tracker MONOTONIC uid INTO the track dict itself, on first sight
    (``tr["_bill_uid"]``, from the counter ``make_team_tracker`` attaches as ``tracker._o16_uid_counter``)
    and keying ``billed_ids`` on THAT instead. This is immune to address recycling by construction: a
    freshly allocated dict -- REGARDLESS of what memory it occupies -- starts with none of its own keys,
    so ``"_bill_uid" not in tr`` is true for every genuinely new track and false for every track that
    already has one, with no dependence on the object's address. Extra keys on a ``TeamTracker`` track
    dict do not confuse ``TeamTracker`` itself (it only ever reads specific keys it wrote, never
    inspects a track's full key set or length).

    ``billed_ids`` (uids, not addresses) is kept one per (match, tracker) and never reset mid-match, so a
    track is billed AT MOST ONCE for its life; a track that later EXPIRES and a brand-new track created
    at the same spot afterward is -- correctly -- a different dict with no ``_bill_uid`` yet, so it CAN
    be billed again (matches live: a new ``TeamTracker`` track is a new track, full stop). Mutates
    ``tracker`` (via ``tag()``, plus the ``_bill_uid`` stamp) and ``billed_ids`` in place."""
